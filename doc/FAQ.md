# LibreTaxi FAQ

#### Q: I bought a Xiaomi Mi5 in China. I don't have Google Play Store or services. I downloaded Telegram APK from ApkMirror. But the app won't install. I get an error due to Google Play Services. How do I solve this?
A: Telegram needs Google Play Services. You can use [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/en/about/) to install [Telegram-FOSS](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.telegram.messenger/) that do not have that dependency or you can use [The Open Gapps](https://opengapps.org/#aboutsection) as an GApps altertive to make the play store version work.
